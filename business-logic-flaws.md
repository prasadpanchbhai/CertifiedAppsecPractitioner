Business logic flaws are errors in the way a system is designed or implemented that can have serious impacts on the system’s functionality. These flaws can range from incorrect calculations to incorrect authorization levels, and can lead to data breaches and financial losses. In this article, we’ll go over different types of business logic flaws and provide some best practices for avoiding them.

### **Types of Business Logic Flaws**

Business logic flaws can be divided into two broad categories: flaws in the design of the system and flaws in the implementation of the system.

#### **Design Flaws**

* Design flaws are errors in the way the system is conceptualized that can lead to business logic problems. These can include improper authorization levels, incorrect data validation, and incorrect data storage.

#### **Improper Authorization Levels**

* When designing a system, it is important to consider which user should have access to which functions. If the authorization levels are not set correctly, users may be able to access data or functions they should not be able to access. For example, a user with a low authorization level might be able to view sensitive data or delete records.

#### **Incorrect Data Validation**

* Data validation is the process of verifying that the data entered into a system is valid. If the validation is not performed correctly, incorrect data can be stored in the system, which can lead to incorrect calculations or other errors. For example, if an application fails to validate the data entered into a form, a user might be able to enter an incorrect age, which could lead to incorrect calculations related to age.

#### **Incorrect Data Storage**

* Data storage is the process of storing data in a system for later retrieval. If the data is not stored properly, errors can occur when the data is retrieved. For example, if a system stores data in an unencrypted format, it is possible for the data to be stolen or compromised.

#### **Implementation Flaws**

* Implementation flaws are errors in the way the system is implemented that can lead to business logic problems. These can include incorrect calculations, incorrect data storage, and incorrect authorization levels.

#### **Incorrect Calculations**

* Incorrect calculations can lead to incorrect results, which can have serious impacts on the system’s functionality. For example, if an application fails to correctly calculate the tax due on a purchase, the user could be charged the wrong amount.

#### **Incorrect Data Storage**

* Data storage should be handled correctly to ensure data is not compromised. If the data is not stored properly, it can be vulnerable to theft or manipulation. For example, if the data is stored in an unencrypted format, it can be stolen or changed.

#### **Incorrect Authorization Levels**

* Authorization levels should be set correctly to ensure users are not able to access data or functions they should not be able to access. If the authorization levels are not set correctly, users may be able to access data or functions they should not be able to access. For example, a user with a low authorization level might be able to view sensitive data or delete records.

### **Best Practices for Avoiding Business Logic Flaws**

To avoid business logic flaws, it is important to follow best practices when designing and implementing a system.

#### **Design Best Practices**

* When designing a system, it is important to think through the security implications of the design. This includes considering the authorization levels, data validation, and data storage.

#### **Authorization Levels**

* When designing a system, it is important to consider which user should have access to which functions. Setting the authorization levels correctly is essential to ensure users are not able to access data or functions they should not be able to access.

#### **Data Validation**

* Data validation is essential to ensure that the data entered into a system is valid. It is important to consider the types of data that will be entered into the system and ensure that validation is performed for each type.

#### **Data Storage**

* Data storage should be handled correctly to ensure data is not compromised. It is important to consider the security implications of data storage and ensure that data is stored in an encrypted format.

#### **Implementation Best Practices**

* When implementing a system, it is important to consider the security implications of the implementation. This includes ensuring calculations are performed correctly, data is stored securely, and authorization levels are set correctly.

#### **Calculations**

* It is important to ensure that calculations are performed correctly to ensure accurate results. This includes ensuring that the correct data is used in the calculations and that the calculations are performed correctly.

#### **Data Storage**

* Data storage should be handled correctly to ensure data is not compromised. It is important to ensure that data is stored in an encrypted format and that the data is stored securely.

#### **Authorization Levels**

* Authorization levels should be set correctly to ensure users are not able to access data or functions they should not be able to access. It is important to ensure that the authorization levels are set correctly and that users are not able to access data or functions they should not be able to access.

### **Conclusion**

Business logic flaws can have serious impacts on the system’s functionality, leading to data breaches and financial losses. To avoid business logic flaws, it is important to follow best practices when designing and implementing a system, including considering authorization levels, data validation, and data storage. By following these best practices, organizations can ensure their systems are secure and data is not compromised.
